# Etiquette

> Karen has an etiquette? Strange 🤔

Listen up everyone, this will address the Karen Bot etiquette

## Commit etiquette

- Only push small commits (e.g if you changed 2 files, commit one file, commit the other and only *then* push) 🤏
- Keep commit titles short and explain them in the description of the commit
- **DO NOT PUSH TO MAIN BRANCH!** Push to a new branch (e.g `username-whatyouchanged` and create a PR)

## Pull Request etiquette

So, this is the etiquette for Pull Requests. Pull Requests are a very useful thing for maintainers and it ensures that the correct people can review your code before it goes into production. That said, let's lay out the rules.

A good example is available on [github.com/Exerra-Discord/karen-bot-docs/pull/1](https://github.com/Exerra/karen-bot-docs/pull/1) 😅

### PR Metadata

- Add the correct labels 🏷️
- If it is related to a milestone, add it to a milestone 🏁
- If it is related to an open issue, link it to that issue ❌
- Assign everyone who worked on that pull request 👩🏾‍🤝‍👩🏻
- Assign a reviewer (@Exerra is a good choice) when you're ready for the code to be reviewed 👩🏼‍⚖️
- If you aren't done adding stuff to the PR, make it a draft PR by clicking the down arrow next to the green "Create Pull Request" button and selecting "Draft pull request" ✅
- Don't turn off notifications, please

### Actual PR contents

- Write a proper title that briefly explains what it does
- Write a detailed description of what you did (and what you will do if you selected "Draft Pull Request")

### Draft PR rules

- When you're done, click "Ready to review"

## Issue etiquette

Oh look, the etiquette for Issues! Issues are a very essential thing for highlighting issues in a project. Wether it be a bug, a typo in documentation, something not being there and so on, Issues is the way to go. So, let's look at the Karen Bot etiquette for them!

### Issue Metadata

- Add the correct labels 🏷️
- If it is related to a project, link that project 🧑🏽‍🤝‍🧑🏼
- If it is related to a milestone, add it to a milestone 🏁
- If it is related to an open Pull Request, link it to that PR ⛓️
- Assign people you think could work on the issue 👩
- Don't turn off notifications, please ✉️

### Actual issue contents

- Write a proper title that briefly explains what the issue is meant for
- Write a long and detailed description of what the issue is, how you think it could be solved and IF you would like to solve it. All of that info greatly helps the maintainers of Karen Bot determine the right way to handle it.
