# Etiquette
> Karen has an etiquette? Strange 🤔

Listen up everyone, this will address the Karen Bot etiquette

## Commit etiquette
- Only push small commits (e.g if you changed 2 files, commit one file, commit the other and only <i>then</i> push) 🤏
- Keep commit titles short and explain them in the description of the commit 
- **DO NOT PUSH TO MASTER BRANCH!** Push to a new branch (e.g username-whatyouchanged and create a PR)

## Pull Request etiquette
So, this is the etiquette for Pull Requests. Pull Requests are a very useful thing for maintainers and it ensures that the correct people can review your code before it goes into production. That said, let's lay out the rules.

A good example is available on [github.com/Exerra-Discord/karen-bot-docs/pull/1](https://github.com/Exerra-Discord/karen-bot-docs/pull/1) 😅

### Metadata
- Add the correct labels 🏷️
- If it is related to a milestone, add it to a milestone 🏁
- If it is related to an open issue, link it to that issue ❌
- Assign everyone who worked at that pull request 👩🏾‍🤝‍👩🏻
- Assign a reviewer (@Exerra is a good choice) when you're ready for the code to be reviewed 👩🏼‍⚖️
- If you aren't done adding stuff to the PR, make it a draft PR by clicking the down arrow next to the green "Create Pull Request" button and selecting "Draft pull request" ✅

Example:

### Actual PR contents
- Write a proper title that briefly explains what it does
- Write a detailed description of what you did (and what you will do if you selected "Draft Pull Request")

### Draft PR rules
- When you're done, click "Ready to review"
